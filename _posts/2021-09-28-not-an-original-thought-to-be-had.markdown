<h1>Nope, nothing from me...</h1>

I don't know what this is supposed to be...thoughts and prayers, half hatched ideas.

There is chaos inside. A violent, restless anger. Taking up all of the space. It's odd because it is completely silent. No 'inner monologue' converting anything into words, therefore no noise - just chaotic silence. no monologue means it is difficult to extract the words or the meaning. 
To think and then struggle to translate that into words I can use. 

Not an original thought I'm sure. Everything has been done before...I am a copycat trying to copy and paste a combination of snippets of other successful people's creations.
 
Geesh - Dark. Maybe I should go and read some stoic writings from Marcus Aurelius and cheer up. 

I guess I'll use this as a mechanism to extrapolate my thoughts and try to create something original. 
Otherwise i'll just use this as a project board.
Try a couple things, fail a bit, try some more. 

noise for noise's sake, but if one must use a forum to better one's self, one must.
