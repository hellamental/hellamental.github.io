I'm sure I'll come edit this page at some point in the future...

But for now:
I'm an electrical engineer that never got into any 'real' engineering work
Instead I have been into spreadsheets, software and strategy.

I want to get good at computers - I want mad programmer skills.
I want hacking skills - pull it apart, put it back together better kind of skills.
But I am also like many others of my generation with an excruciatingly short attention span - I think it's due to the technology, which I love but also hate. 

Anyways, trying to find some exciting projects and learn some stuff...

See-Ya
